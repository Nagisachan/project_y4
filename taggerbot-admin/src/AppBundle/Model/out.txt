Course Description 
Mathematical modeling is a representation of a natural/artificial phenomenon. It bridges the 
gap between problems and computational infrastructures. It provides a means to simulate 
those processes underlying the problem using computers. Understanding the concepts of 
mathematical modeling is essential for computer engineers to be able to see through the 
mechanisms of nature and capture the core processes using mathematics. 
This course discusses relevant mathematical modeling methods commonly used in 
computer engineering applications. Topics include discrete structures, probabilistic models, 
and dynamical system models. Example applications for each method will also be provided, 
including hardware and software design, computer architecture, networking, artificial 
intelligence, pattern recognition, and computer graphics. Students will be asked to pick 
topics to model engineering problems. 
Department Policy on Academic Dishonesty 
 All types of academic misconduct will be treated seriously. If there are evidences of 
plagiarism, cheating, or fabrication in any work, the score of that work will be set to 
zero. Continuing to do so will result in failing this course.  
 Late assignments will be accepted only within the next 24 hours while scores for late 
assignments will be deducted 25% as a penalty.
